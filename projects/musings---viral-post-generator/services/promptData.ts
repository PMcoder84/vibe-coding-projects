Everyone's pivoting to generative AI.

But my alarm bells go off when I see:

🚩 A crowded landscape
🚩 FOMO driven decision making
🚩 Sky high valuations for an early space

Here are 5 questions to ask to understand if a gen AI product will be successful: 

1/ If you took the word "AI" out, is the product still solving a customer problem?

AI is a solution, not a problem.

Ask yourself:

1. What is the pain point?
2. How many users share this pain?
3. Is the pain big enough to take action?
4. Is the pain underserved by non-AI tools?

2/ How accurate does the solution need to be?

Plot the problem on a fluency + accuracy grid.

Gen AI is great for high fluency + low accuracy problems (e.g., productivity).

It's not great for solutions that need high accuracy (e.g., finances). More here:

3/ How fast will incumbents move?

Incumbents like Microsoft, Google, and Adobe have moved incredibly fast on gen AI.

Startups that overlap with core incumbent use cases might struggle.

e.g., AI presentation startups need to be MUCH better than AI in Powerpoint to thrive.

4/ Is there a moat?

Examples moats include:

- Access to proprietary data and models
- Exclusive contracts with large customers
- Great product even without AI
- Exceptional talent in the selected field
- Business models that incumbents avoid

And of course...speed of execution.

5/ Does the valuation make sense?

If an AI application already has $100M+ valuation, you should think:

Can this continue to grow and (more importantly) retain users?

In a crowded space like AI copywriting and productivity - that could get hard.

6/ To recap, here are 5 questions to ask to evaluate AI products and companies:

1. Without "AI", is it still solving a problem?
2. How accurate does the solution need to be?
3. How fast will incumbents move?
4. Is there a moat?
5. Does the valuation make sense?

A personal story about Satya Nadella's superpower from a Microsoft VP:

"A few weeks after I joined Microsoft, Satya randomly called me and my manager to chat. 

During those 30 minutes, he only asked questions. He asked about our thoughts on the product strategy, Microsoft’s culture, and what we thought needed change. 

Here you have this CEO of a $2 trillion company just listening to two new employees instead of telling us what to do. That’s remarkable. 

Later on, I realized that this is how Satya gathers signal. 

He’s really good at getting different points of view from different sources and then connecting the dots on what needs to be fixed. 

It’s remarkable that he can do this without falling into the temptation of telling you what to do."

As Satya himself wrote in his book, Hit Refresh:

"Listening is the most important thing that I accomplished each day because it would build the foundation of my leadership for years to come."

This is one of the best cold emails ever.

But here a 3 ways that it could be even better:

1. Create a hook
The subject line needs a better hook than "internship." e.g., "Snapchat feedback from 10 high schoolers + internship"

2. Add value
Give first, then ask. e.g., "I spoke to 10 classmates, here's a doc with quotes on how Snapchat can be better."

3. Make a low-effort ask 
A simple "How" is already infinitely better than "Want to schedule some time to chat?" But the ask could be even more specific. e.g., "Can you forward this to a recruiter?"

I escaped the rat race 2.5 years ago.

My secret sauce is less ambition.

I don't:

- want to change the world.
- want to build the next unicorn.
- want to be featured on any lists.
- want to get the highest valuation.

Instead:

- I want to spend my time working on things I enjoy with people I enjoy.
- I want to be able to travel wherever I want to, whenever I want to.
- I want to spend way more time with my friends and family.
- I want to stop doing things I don't like doing.

Thinking about what you actually want in life can force different behavior.

Take you down a different path.

A path towards living more intentionally.

Are you copying someone else's life?

Or designing your own?

When I worked a 9 to 5, I cared about:
- Job title
- Salary + OTE
- Number of direct reports
- What peers thought about me

As a solopreneur, I care about:
- Health
- Network
- Free time
- Creativity
- Time with my wife
- Location independence

A wonderful mindset shift.

STRICT RULES:
1. The first two lines must create a strong curiosity gap and be less than 45 characters each.
2. Use short paragraphs, often just one or two sentences.
3. Include numbered lists or bullet points where relevant.
4. Include a clear call-to-action (CTA) or question at the end.
5. NO hashtags. NO cringe.
6. Conversational tone.
7. FORMATTING: Use double line breaks (one empty line) between every paragraph to create whitespace.
